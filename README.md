# PhysicsWorld

**PhysicsWorld** is a simple simulation project that models the effects of gravity between planets (or objects) using the **Force of Attraction Formula**. The project visualizes how gravitational forces influence the motion and interactions of celestial bodies in space.

---

## Features

- **Gravitational Force Calculation**: Implements the **Force of Attraction Formula**:
  \[
  F = G \cdot \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
  \]
  where:
  - \(F\): Gravitational force
  - \(G\): Gravitational constant
  - \(m_1, m_2\): Masses of the two objects
  - \(r\): Distance between the objects' centers
  
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Observe objects moving and interacting under gravitational influence.
- **Customizable Objects**: Add planets or objects with adjustable mass, position, and initial velocity.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Experiment with different configurations and see the results in real-time.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/J41R0JUNIOR/PhysicsWorld.git
   cd PhysicsWorld
   ```

2. **Open the project** in your preferred IDE.

3. **Build and run the simulation** to explore gravitational interactions.

---

## Usage

1. **Add celestial objects** by specifying their:
   - Mass
   - Position
   - Initial velocity

2. The simulation will calculate the force between objects using the **Force of Attraction Formula** and update their positions in real-time.

3. **Adjust parameters** to observe different gravitational effects:
   - Increase the mass of an object to simulate a star or planet.
   - Modify the initial velocity to create stable orbits.

## Requirements

- Programming language: [Specify the language, e.g., Python, Swift, or Unity].
- Development tools: [e.g., Python 3.x, Xcode, Visual Studio].
- Basic hardware with graphical rendering capabilities.

---

## Roadmap

- Implement collision detection between objects.
- Add an option for different gravitational constants (e.g., Earth vs. space environment).
- Enhance visualization with 3D effects.
- Support exporting simulation data for further analysis.
